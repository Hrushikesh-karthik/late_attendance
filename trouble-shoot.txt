pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel build
or
pip install setuptools==68.2.2

ðŸ”§ Optional Fix: Modify Problematic Package
If the issue is caused by a specific package (e.g., mysqlclient), and youâ€™re not using it directly (since you already have PyMySQL), remove or comment out this line in requirements.txt:

txt
Copy code
# mysqlclient==2.1.0
Then rerun the install.
